# Overview

When I started this project, Avengers was a week from coming out, and Game of Thrones was on its 3rd episode of its final season. In order to familiarize myself more with databases, and because I was simply interested in finding out the results, I decided to collect all of the tweets relating to 'avengers' and 'gameofthrones'. There were other keywords I could've used at the time which would make the data more reliable, but those are the terms I used.

In the src folder, I include the database schema. I didn't include the database itself because it was over 2GB of data. I ran the scraping script on a raspberry pi for a week and after the week, I used plotly to create graphs to better visualized the results.

# Future work

I'm working on adding this to my website as an interactive graph. I want to rewrite the graphing script to include all of the data, and I'd like to rewrite it using the javascript library D3.js
